### Introduction

Everything we do in our modern world is done online. We are constantly connected to the rest of world through our electronic devices, and the backbone of all this communication is the `Internet` - but what is actually happening when you browse online? What data is your computer sending and recieving, and what other machines and networks are being used in order to provide web content in the blink of an eye?

**Insight Browser** allows you to peek behind the curtain and see what actually goes on when you navigate the internet.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a tool that ANYONE can use in order to educate themselves on the digital landscape and the footprint they leave when they interact with content online. 

### Usage
Fundamentally, **Insight Browser** is just that - a web browser! And should be used as such. At the end of each browsing session you will be shown a dashboard breaking down all of the data from your journey across the internet, including all the sites you visited, all the sites that THOSE sites communicated with and much more.
